## Introduction

Jobalizer is a tool designed to automate the job application process. It helps you apply to multiple job postings efficiently by automating repetitive tasks, such as filling out application forms and tracking application statuses.

## Features

- Automated form filling
- Job application tracking
- Customizable templates for cover letters and resumes
- Integration with popular job boards
- Notifications for application status updates

## Prerequisites

Before installing Jobalizer, ensure you have the following:

- **Operating System**: Linux, macOS, or Windows 10/11
- **Docker**: Version 20.10 or higher
- **Docker Compose**: Version 1.29 or higher
- **Git**: For cloning the repository

## Installation

To install Jobalizer, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jobalizer.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```sh
    cd jobalizer
    ```

## Docker Setup

You can build and run Jobalizer using Docker to simplify the setup process and ensure consistency across environments.

### Build and Install the Docker Image

1. **Set Up Environment Variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add your configuration settings:

   ```ini
   FLASK_ENV=development
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   GENERATE_REQUIREMENTS=false
   ```

   **Environment Variable Descriptions:**

   - `FLASK_ENV`: Sets the Flask environment. Use `development` for development mode or `production` for production.
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key for AI-powered features.
   - `FLASK_SECRET_KEY`: A secret key used by Flask for session management. Generate a strong, random key.
   - `GENERATE_REQUIREMENTS`: Set to `true` if you want the Docker build process to generate `requirements.txt`.

2. **Build the Docker Image:**

   Use the provided build script to build the Docker image with all dependencies:

   ```sh
   chmod +x build_and_install.sh
   ./build_and_install.sh
   ```

   - The script will build the Docker image named `jobalizer:latest`.
   - It includes a retry mechanism and handles cleanup of unused Docker resources.
   - Use the `-v` flag for verbose output:

     ```sh
     ./build_and_install.sh -v
     ```

### Running the Application

You can run the application using Docker Compose or directly with Docker.

#### Option 1: Using Docker Compose

1. **Start the Application:**

   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   - The `-d` flag runs the containers in detached mode.

2. **Access the Application:**

   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.

#### Option 2: Using Docker Run

1. **Run the Docker Container:**

   ```sh
   docker run -p 5000:5000 \
     -e FLASK_APP=main \
     -e FLASK_ENV=${FLASK_ENV:-development} \
     -e OPENAI_API_KEY=${OPENAI_API_KEY} \
     -e FLASK_SECRET_KEY=${FLASK_SECRET_KEY} \
     --env-file .env \
     --restart unless-stopped \
     yourusername/jobalizer:latest
   ```

   - Ensure that your `.env` file contains all necessary variables.

2. **Access the Application:**

   Visit `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser.

## Configuration

Add your credentials and configuration settings to the `.env` file located in the project directory. The `.env` file should contain the necessary environment variables for the application to run properly.

Example `.env` file:

```ini
FLASK_ENV=development
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
GENERATE_REQUIREMENTS=false
```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can:

- **Access the Web Interface:**

  Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to use the Jobalizer web application.

- **Set Up Templates:**

  Customize your cover letters and resumes using the application's template management.

- **Automate Applications:**

  Configure job search criteria and let Jobalizer automate the application process.

- **Track Application Status:**

  Monitor the status of your job applications directly from the dashboard.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during installation or while running the application, consider the following:

- **Docker Build Errors:**

  - Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed and running properly.
  - Check your network connection if you encounter DNS resolution errors during the build process.
  - Use the `-v` flag with the build script for detailed logs.

- **Application Not Accessible:**

  - Confirm that the container is running using `docker ps`.
  - Ensure that port `5000` is not being used by another application.
  - Check the application logs with `docker logs <container_id>`.

- **Missing Dependencies:**

  - Verify that all environment variables are correctly set in your `.env` file.
  - If `requirements.txt` is not up-to-date, set `GENERATE_REQUIREMENTS=true` and rebuild the image.

## Testing

To run the application's test suite:

1. **Enter the Docker Container:**

   ```sh
   docker exec -it $(docker ps -q -f "ancestor=yourusername/jobalizer:latest") /bin/bash
   ```

2. **Run Tests:**

   ```sh
   pytest tests/
   ```

   - Ensure that `pytest` is included in your `requirements.txt` or installed within the container.
